                Meet Ahsoka, a beautiful female tabby Domestic Short-hair cat with a soft coat of black and brown fur. Ahsoka adores spending time outdoors in the backyard, and her favorite spot is the cozy kitty condo that my mother crafted for the cats. She has remarkable agility and grace, often resembling a wild cat as she stealthily stalks her prey. Her hunting skills are impressive, and she has a penchant for catching lizards, baby frogs, and dragonflies. I vividly recall the time she caught a small bird, similar to the ones found in grocery store parking lots, and brought it inside while it was still alive. When I managed to get her to release it, the bird darted through the house, prompting a lively chase. Fortunately, I was able to guide the bird back outside, and it flew away. Despite her hunting prowess, Ahsoka is also an incredibly affectionate and loving companion. <br><br>
She has a tendency to walk right past me, go to the bathroom door, and meow at the door, thinking that Iâ€™m in the bathroom. I know this because when I go to see what is going on, she sees me and lets out an excited meow.<br><br>
Below are some pictures of Ahsoka.
