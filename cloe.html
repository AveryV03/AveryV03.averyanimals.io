        <!--information about Cloe-->
        <P>Meet Cloe, a female Shih Tzu with a fluffy white coat with charming brown spots. Her love for food is unrivaled; whenever someone enters the kitchen, she eagerly accompanies them, patiently waiting for them to accidentally drop some food on the floor. Her enthusiasm for food has earned her the nickname "chow hound." Additionally, Cloe has a particular fondness for snacks and often pesters my father, knowing that he is likely to give her a treat. I have a vivid memory of a time when I was in the middle of cracking open some crab legs, and accidentally dropped a fairly large piece of shell on the floor. Without a moment's hesitation, Cloe swiftly swooped like a shark, snatched it up, and dashed away with it. By the time I caught up to her, she had miraculously managed to devour the entire piece. Even though Cloe appears to be a peaceful dog, she is quite feisty and has a temper. For example, when I tried to pick her up and put her in the camper, she started growling at me. My mother likes to say she's like a salty old lady. However, when she was young, she loved having her belly rubbed. Whenever you went to pet her, she would instantly roll onto her back for you to rub her belly, and when you stopped, she would then scratch/pat your arm, begging for you to keep rubbing her. Despite her quirks and being not the easiest to get along with, I still love her the same as my other animals.</P>
