    <h1>Luna</h1>
    <h2>2013-Present</h2>
    <h2>Nickname: Lunas, Ms. Luna.</h2>
    <main><p>Meet Luna, a beautiful female Persian cat with a luxurious grey calico fur coat. Currently, Luna resides with my sister in the picturesque state of Washington. However, as Luna was originally one of my cherished pets, I decided to feature her on this website. Luna possesses a discerning nature; she tends to cast disapproving glances when something displeases her. Interestingly, Luna didn't seem to take a liking to my mother, perhaps because when Luna was just a tiny kitten, my mother would lovingly cuddle her in her arms. During our time in Maine, Luna took great pleasure in going outdoors to chase after butterflies and moths. One quirk that never failed to amuse us was Luna's preference for strolling along the rows of bricks that lined my mother's flowerbeds, rather than treading upon the soft grass to reach the back porch. That said Luna is an exceptionally gentle cat who has never scratched anyone, and she loves being brushed.</p>
