    <h2>Nickname: Miilord.</h2>
    <main>
    <p>Meet Milord, a charming male Domestic Long-hair cat with a luxurious coat of grey and white fur. He has a particular fondness for wet cat food - the moment he hears the pop of the cat food pack being split open; he comes rushing over with enthusiasm. However, Milord can also be a little punk. On rainy days when he's cooped up inside the house, he can become restless and a touch irritable, often engaging in lively, rough play with Ahsoka, sometimes to the point of being a bit too vigorous. When this happens, we open the door to the garage, and he eagerly dashes into the garage, when he is in the garage he likes to hunt for bugs. Sometimes he likes to set a trap on you by laying on his back exposing his fluffy pure white belly just enticing you to come pet it, but when you do, with all four paws he continues to grab onto your hand and bunny kick your hand.<br><br>

        Nevertheless, Milord is a sweetheart. He has a soft spot for baskets; whenever a new one enters the house, he must test it out by nestling inside. His favorite place to lay in the backyard is underneath my motherâ€™s flower plants.<br><br>
        Below are some pictures of Milord.
