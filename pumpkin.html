    <p>Meet Pumpkin. He is a male tabby half-Maine Coon cat with a fluffy orange fur coat. Pumpkin was a very mischievous cat. He loved messing with my mother by scratching the couch and looking her straight in the eyes while he was doing it. My mother would then say, “PUMPKIN!” and he would dart off after she said it. Another thing he would do, and he did this to everyone, is hide behind the curtain my mother had hanging in the doorway of the laundry room (instead of a door) and wait for someone to walk by. When someone did walk by, he would attack their feet. But despite his mischievous ways, he was a very kind cat, always lying on my lap when we were watching TV in the living room. One of the funny things about him is that whenever you would touch his tail, it twitched. He also loved going outside to hunt critters with Smokey, catching all sorts of things. Sadly, a few months before we moved from Maine to North Carolina, he went outside and disappeared. Although he is gone, he will always be loved and remembered.</p>
    <p>Below are some pictures of Pumpkin. </p>
