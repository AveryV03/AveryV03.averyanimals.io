    <p>This is Stewie, a male Miniature Schnauzer dog with soft black fur. He is the pet that I mentioned on the home page. As I mentioned, he recently passed away at the age of 15. What I miss the most since his passing is some of the annoying things he would do and his goofiness. For example, one of the annoying things he would do is whenever he wanted to get on the couch, he would make this huffing noise as if he wanted permission. I would then say, "Come on Stewie, jump up boy," and tap the couch with my hand, but he would still sit there huffing. I would repeat saying that, and only when I started to get annoyed would he jump up. One of the goofy and funny things he would do is roll on his back and then start kicking his legs up in the air trying to itch his back. Another goofy thing he'd do is that whenever he got excited, he would start jumping around in a circle like a goat and act silly. Despite his passing, he will always be loved and remembered.</p>
    <p>Below are some pictures of Stewie.</p>
