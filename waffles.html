    <h1>Waffles</h1>
    <h2>2010-2017</h2>
    <h2>Nickname: Wafflemaker.</h2>
    <main><p>Meet Waffles. He is a male tabby Domestic Short-hair cat with a brown and black coat and a white belly. Waffles was a natural-born hunter. He loved being outside and spent most of his time there. The only time he wasn’t outside was when it was cold or raining, although I tried to get him in at night. He brought back a variety of things, ranging from a lizard to a whole squirrel! I remember one time he brought in something and was messing with it in the office. The dogs, Stewie and Cloe, walked up to him to see what he had. When they got close, he jumped on top of it, hiding it underneath his fur. Once they had walked out of sight, he continued to mess with it. I went to see what it was, and it turned out to be a lizard. I picked it up and took it outside. When I sat it down, it was still alive and darted off. He became very skittish after an incident when he came back injured because something had bitten him. Of course, I took him to the vet, and it wasn’t a serious injury, but it did not affect his skills at all as one week later, he caught a bunny rabbit. Despite his wildness, he was a loving cat, always lying on the couch with me when he came into the house to rest. Sadly, when we were in the process of moving to Maine, he went outside one day and didn’t come back, but even though he is gone he will always be loved and cherished.</p><p>Below are some pictures of waffles. Sadly, when I had Waffles, I wasn’t a big picture taker and smartphones weren’t very popular yet, so I only have a few good pictures of him.</p>
